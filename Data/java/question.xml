	<Explanation>
Since a has static storage duration and no initializer, it is guaranteed to be zero-initialized. Had a been defined as a local non-static variable inside main(), this would not have happened.

Note: int a has static storage duration because it is declared at namespace scope. It does not need to have static in front of it, that would only denote internal linkage.


	</Explanation>
	<Hint>
Is a static? And what do we mean by &#x22;static&#x22; anyway? Think about the difference between static storage duration and external linkage.
